# Project "Labyrinth".

##About
Were there any troubles while solving the Maze problem?
Ans is "yes" in case standard solvers were to show up in the real world.
To tackle this problem smart robots with generalization ability came into 
place. Trained on small mazes they are able to do well in large ones.

This argument, supplied by the fact that real world could be viewed as a
grid (maze), introduces the future, where robots move, backed by DRL 
techniques.

## Usage
 Having python working interpreter and pypi package manager is mandatory.
 When this is satisfied, in console:
 
 - pip install -r requirements.txt
 - python tkinter_main.py
